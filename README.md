# Principle of Database and Management Project

# Online Examination Management System

## About The Project
- The Final Project for the IU' 2025 Principle of Database and Management course.

- An Online Examination Management System is a computerized platform designed to organize, deliver, and manage online exams efficiently. It features a structured database for managing students, courses, and exam results, along with separate interfaces for students and administrators.

- The system enables students to register for exams and view their results. Instructor or administrator accounts, which are restricted to authorized staff, have permission to create and manage exam sessions and evaluate student performance.
- This system aims to streamline the examination workflow, enhance academic integrity, reduce administrative workload, and improve the overall experience for both students and staff.
